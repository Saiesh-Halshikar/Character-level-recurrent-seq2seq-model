# Character-level-recurrent-seq2seq-model
This example demonstrates how to implement a basic character-level recurrent sequence-to-sequence model. We apply it to translating short English sentences into short French sentences, character-by-character. Note that it is fairly unusual to do character-level machine translation, as word-level models are more common in this domain.
